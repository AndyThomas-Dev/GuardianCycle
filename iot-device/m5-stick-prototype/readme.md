# M5 Stick Prototype

We intended the M5 stick to be used as the interface which would trigger the alert on the concerned persons/emergency services view on our website.

The small size of the screen on the M5 stick was very limiting and I realised any complicated user interface loaded onto the stick would likely not be properly visible to the user.

With this in mind, I created a minimalist user interface that consisted of colours to indicate the state of the device.
