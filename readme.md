# Introduction 


## Problem

Data collected by [cycling.org](https://www.cyclinguk.org/blog/road-casualties-2018-vital-statistics-cycle-campaigning) found that - annually for 2018 17,550 cyclists in the UK had got injured with 99 cyclist casaulties. Furthermore, [Bristol alone](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-among-top-five-most-1749111) is considered one of the top 5 most dangerous places to cycle in the whole of the UK. This is despite cycling having tremendous benefits to society - cyclists are [healthier](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits), cycling is [benefitial for the environment](https://biofriendlyplanet.com/green-alternatives/transportation/environmental-reasons-to-start-riding-your-bicycle-more/), it is a fantastic [activity for children](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/get-active/2019/everyday-walking-and-cycling/the-benefits-of-cycling-for-children-and-families/) and so much more. Furthmore, during the 2019-20 Coronavirus crisis [under government guidance](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/coronavirus-cycling-ebikes-cars-lockdown-uk-walking-air-pollution-leeds-university-a9521451.html) - cycling has experienced an [unprecedented boom](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/09/coronavirus-cycling-boom-makes-a-good-bike-hard-to-find) - due to its ability to isolate individuals commuting, reopen the UK economy and ease congestion on roads. Given this, there is an urgent need for more and better applications to make cycling accessible, more enjoyable and safer. In this spirit, IoT devices and applications must be developed to enhance and improve society.

## Vision

The GuardianCycle has be deliberately designed to meet this problem and offer all cycling users far more safety, accessibility and satisfication. Firstly, provide an adjustable LED indicator to provide optimum clarity of cycling maneuvers to fellow road users. Secondly, utilising GPS tracing - the GuardianCycle enables emergency services and friends or family the ability to trace cyclists on the road and provide immediate assistance for any emergencies or unintended problems. Thirdly, the GuardianCycle makes cycling more fun and interesting by offering users unparallelled accessibility to their cycling data - including calories burned and distance travelled - with the view to share this data, challenge friends and set new personal best goals!

GuardianCycle as a multimodal computer architecture offers so much more than just these initial benefits, which are thoroughly explored within the body of our report. Architecturally, GuardianCycle consists of three main components: 

#### An IoT device and RGB LED hardware

The GuardianCycle IoT device is clearly prototyped using an M5Stack - it transmits GPS data in JSON files - both route data gathered or emergency notifications and renders an RGB LED matrix to perform manoeuvres. All operable through an easy and optimum user interface. 

#### A desktop application

#### A web application

To cater for two different sets of external stakeholders, two single page applications have been developed using the React framework:
- friend-track-view which allows the cyclist to share their location with friends and family and
- emergency-services-view which alerts the emergency services to incidents detected by GuardianCycle.

## Advantages

The Guardian Cycle offers a number of key benefits to society and across multiple stakeholders, which are presently unavailable to cyclists within the UK and across the world.

#### Safety 

In short, the GuardianCycle maximises road safety for cyclists as it will help minimise cycling fatalities and accident occurrence on and off road. Through GPS tracing the GuardianCycle can trigger immediate emergency assistance as well as enable friends or family to trace journeys. This benefits a vast array of potential cyclists from cyclists mountain biking solo in the hills to cyclists commuting to work on busy streets. Furthermore, as cycling accidents are most common on the road, we have developed an LED indicator system to clearly notify manoeuvres to fellow road users.

#### Accessible cycling data 

The desktop application explores achievements made by the cyclist day-to-day - dramatically improving their cycling experience. In particular, GuardianCycle data collected focuses on routes gathered, distance travelled and calories burned. Immeasurably improving the cycling experience and inspiring cyclists to get fitter and healthier via setting goals, personal bests and challenging friends. 

#### User focused interfaces

All three interfaces, the M5Stack, desktop application and website offer incredible accessibility to potential stakeholders. The three interfaces have been configured to be as clear and effective as possible. Thus providing a wholesome service for all cyclist users - from novice to veteran cyclists. As noted, within the user stories section GuardianCycle's interface and system even benefits non-cyclists.
