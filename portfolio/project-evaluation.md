## 3. Project Evaluation

### a. Reflective discussion of the success of the project

### b. Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)

While we believe our project demonstates a strong case for proof of concept, there are areas of improvement and many wider considerations that need to be accounted for in the case this project progresses further.

#### Market Research
While our device was born about due to the concerns of the two keen cyclists on our team, conducting more detailed market research with potential user groups to determine the viabiltiy of our product. For example, this might involve focus groups or interviews with cyclists to determine how concerned they are with their safety and whether they would consider purchasing a device that might help them in that regard. This would also be a good opportunity to address any privacy concerns (as the device intends to utilise a GPS tracker).

In this regard, one key future consideration that we did not explore thoroughly is how the emergency services would utilise our website. During the inception phase, it was envisioned that either the ambulance dispatcher or a device within the ambulance itself would have the website running in order to track the incident. The feasability of this was purely speculative and in reality would have to involve a very thorough conversation with the emergency services.

A potential test would be to utilise the device for emergency services staff that were manning a cycling event. This would allow emergency services to test the device & website in a controlled environment to determine it’s suitability for more widespread use.

#### Improved User Customisation
We were keen to add further user customisation into our desktop application but did not have the time to implement this. For example, we envisioned the user having an account (or signing in using either their Gmail or Facebook) that would store all their routes and statistics. They could also view their overrall statistics (aggragated for every route stored). 

The function which calculates calories burned is intended to rely on user data which in our implementation is hardcoded. The ideal implementation of this would involve the user submitting this data upon account creation therefore ensuring the calculation is accurate for that particular user.

Another small feature would be for the user to display distances in Imperial units, rather than metric as certain users would feel more comfortable with this. While this was on the cards for some time, ultimately it was never actioned as it was not a key feature and there were more pressing design concerns (notably creating an optimal UI layout).

#### Implementing Social Networking Features
We discussed the long-term goal of introducing or integrating social networking features. This could involve the ability to upload routes to social media websites such as Facebook or cycling apps such as Strava. This could allow users to share routes with their friends or challenge each other, for example to complete a route in a faster time. Social networking elements could also be integrated within desktop application as well. For example, messaging between riders or leaderboards with who has burned the most calories in that particular month.

#### Hardware Improvements
If the project was to be viable, this would certainly require changes to the prescribed hardware. Paramount is the need for the device to function as a GPS tracker which could be done by adding an external component. This could also be potentially achieved by bluetooth pairing the stack with a mobile device. However, this would then require the user to keep their phone with them at all times during their journey.

While the M5 stick interface achieves it’s basic aims, we believe this could be improved by implementing further functionality. For example, a timer could be displayed after the alarm has been triggered to inform the user of how long they have been waiting for a response. 

### c. Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc).

#### Agile

The [Agile](https://www.agilemanifesto.org/) software development methodology was chosen for this project.  This proved to have advantages and disadvantages.  The primary strength was Agile's emphasis on working software - we were trying to develop a minimum viable product rather than production ready artefacts which would include extensive testing, documentation, etc.  Consequently each group meet up was primarily orientated around discussion of features built or proposed and "showing the thing" (as defined by the [Government Digital Service](https://gdsengagement.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/04/what-we-mean-when-we-say-show-the-thing/)).  This kept the project focussed on development, rather than becoming too enmeshed in process or administration.

There were however downsides to this approach.  Frequently Agile (which in its purest form is more a statement of principles than a methodology) is used with a framework such as [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org) which brings with it concepts such as sprints and product owners.  These more fine-grained features were more difficult to successfully implement however.  For instance although we attempted to use sprints, whereby effort is focussed on building features within a defined period, followed by review and then selecting new features off the backlog, in practice this proved challenging.  Primarily as deadlines for other assignments could not be fully deconflicted with GuardianCycle sprints, and understandably these took precedence; meaning working on new features was often interrupted by other demands, which is contrary to the sprint ethos where feature development is the over-riding focus in that period.  Also the concept of a Product Owner, who acts as the voice of the business, was not realised.  This was partly due to the nature of the assignment where there was no 'business' and because the product we were building was genuinely a shared concept to which everyone contributed (in start-up terms the entire team were 'founders'). Therefore there was no sole voice who represented the decision maker for domain or business conflicts.  As team members tended, understandably, to be passionate about their elements of the design, it is likely this role would have been useful in prioritisation, and is recommended for future projects.

### d. This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote working practices etc)
The unexpected coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown had a significant effect on our working pratices. The most significant being the inability to engage in regular face-to-face meetings as we had before. We quickly adapted to this new environment however by instead engaging in regular teleconferences via Skype. We also extended our use of the messaging service Slack for communication and shared workspaces such as Google drive in order to track our progress.
