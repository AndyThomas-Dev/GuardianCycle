## 3. Project Evaluation

### a. Reflective discussion of the success of the project

### b. Discussion of future work (in terms of design, development and evaluation)

### c. Reflect on the working practices of your group, how well they did or did not work, e.g, management of issues, communication, Agile (etc).

#### Agile

The [Agile](https://www.agilemanifesto.org/) software development methodology was chosen for this project.  This proved to have advantages and disadvantages.  The primary strength was Agile's emphasis on working software - we were trying to develop a minimum viable product rather than production ready artefacts which would include extensive testing, documentation, etc.  Consequently each group meet up was primarily orientated around discussion of features built or proposed and "showing the thing" (as defined by the [Government Digital Service](https://gdsengagement.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/04/what-we-mean-when-we-say-show-the-thing/)).  This kept the project focussed on development, rather than becoming too enmeshed in process or administration.

There were however downsides to this approach.  Frequently Agile (which in its purest form is more a statement of principles than a methodology) is used with a framework such as [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org) which brings with it concepts such as sprints and product owners.  These more fine-grained features were more difficult to successfully implement however.  For instance although we attempted to use sprints, whereby effort is focussed on building features within a defined period, followed by review and then selecting new features off the backlog, in practice this proved challenging.  Primarily as deadlines for other assignments could not be fully deconflicted with GuardianCycle sprints, and understandably these took precedence; meaning working on new features was often interrupted by other demands, which is contrary to the sprint ethos where feature development is the over-riding focus in that period.  Also the concept of a Product Owner, who acts as the voice of the business, was not realised.  This was partly due to the nature of the assignment where there was no 'business' and because the product we were building was genuinely a shared concept to which everyone contributed (in start-up terms the entire team were 'founders'). Therefore there was no sole voice who represented the decision maker for domain or business conflicts.  As team members tended, understandably, to be passionate about their elements of the design, it is likely this role would have been useful in prioritisation, and is recommended for future projects.

### d. This is a chance to reflect on how coronavirus has affected your project (remote working practices etc)
The unexpected coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown had a significant effect on our working pratices. The most significant being the inability to engage in regular face-to-face meetings as we had before. We quickly adapted to this new environment however by instead engaging in regular teleconferences via Skype. We also extended our use of the messaging service Slack for communication and shared workspaces such as Google drive in order to track our progress.
